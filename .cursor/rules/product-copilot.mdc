# Project Rules – Product (cursor-pm-copilot)

- Treat this repository as my personal PM/TPM control center.
- Prefer using:
  - `workspace/docs/` for project notes, daily notes, and status docs.
  - `workspace/templates/` for PRD, TRD, and status templates.
- When I ask you to create a PRD or TRD in this repo:
  - Use the templates in `workspace/templates/` if they exist.
  - Suggest a filename and location under `workspace/docs/`.
- For “summarize this project / feature” requests:
  - Look at PRDs, TRDs, and project notes under `workspace/docs/`.
  - Produce bullet-first summaries that I can paste into Slack, Linear, or Notion.
- Assume that this repo is a **thinking + documentation space** to support my other work repos, not the main application codebase.
