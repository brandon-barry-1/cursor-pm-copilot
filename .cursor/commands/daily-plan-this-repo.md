# daily-plan-this-repo

We are in my cursor-pm-copilot repo.

1. Look at any relevant files under workspace/docs/ that relate to current work.
   - Especially current-projects.md, any today-*.md, and project-specific notes.
2. Summarize:
   - My active projects
   - Any urgent or time-sensitive tasks
3. Propose a prioritized list of 5–7 tasks for today with rough time estimates.
4. Suggest which tasks I should:
   - Do first
   - Schedule for later
   - Defer or drop

Return the result as a markdown list of checkboxes so I can paste it into a today-[date].md file under workspace/docs/.
