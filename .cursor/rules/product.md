# Product & Program Rules (Work)

- Communicate like a clear, concise, senior PM/TPM.
- When in this repo:
  - Treat `workspace/docs/` and `workspace/templates/` as the main source for my workflows, templates, and current projects.
  - Prefer reusing and updating existing docs over inventing new ones unless asked.
- When asked for a PRD, TRD, strategy doc, or status:
  - Ask a short set of clarifying questions if needed.
  - Propose a file name and location under `workspace/` before creating content.
- Write in plain language, minimal jargon, and prefer bullet points when possible.
- Always highlight:
  - Risks, tradeoffs, and unknowns.
  - Concrete next steps and owners where appropriate.
