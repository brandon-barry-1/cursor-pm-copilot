# [Feature Name] – AI/Clinical PRD

## 1. Context & Problem
- What problem are we solving?
- Who is affected (members, clinicians, ops)?
- Why now?

## 2. Goals & Non-Goals
### Goals
- [Measurable outcome 1]
- [Measurable outcome 2]
### Non-Goals
- [Explicitly not doing X]

## 3. Users & Use Cases
### Primary Users
- [Clinician / Member / Ops]
### Key Use Cases
- [UC1]
- [UC2]

## 4. Data & Constraints
- Data sources (labs, notes, internal APIs)
- PHI/PII considerations
- Regulatory / clinical constraints
- Dependencies (Databricks tables, Langfuse traces, internal services)

## 5. Solution Overview
- High-level approach (LLM, rules, hybrid, etc.)
- Key components (pipelines, services, UI surfaces)
- What changes from today?

## 6. Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- [FR1]
- [FR2]
### Non-Functional
- Latency, reliability, observability, guardrails

## 7. Evaluation & Guardrails
- Evaluator types (e.g., factuality, range correctness, safety)
- Key metrics (accuracy, FP/FN, “trust” proxy)
- Langfuse / logging integration
- Rollout gates (what must be true before GA?)

## 8. UX & Interactions
- Surfaces (clinician UI, member UI, internal tools)
- Links to Figma / design references
- Explainability / how we show reasoning

## 9. Risks, Open Questions, and Alternatives
- Technical risks
- Clinical / legal risks
- Open questions
- Alternatives considered

## 10. Rollout Plan
- Phases (internal, limited, GA)
- Comms, training, documentation
