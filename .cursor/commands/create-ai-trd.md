# create-ai-trd

We are in my cursor-pm-copilot repo.

I want to create a Technical Requirements Document (TRD) for a system.

1. Use workspace/templates/trd-function-ai.md as the structure.
2. Read any relevant docs in workspace/docs/, especially:
   - PRDs related to this system
   - Project notes
3. Ask me any clarifying questions you need.
4. Then create a file under workspace/docs/ with a kebab-case filename like "trd-<name>.md" and fill in the TRD.
5. Call out clearly:
   - Architecture
   - Data & models
   - Evaluations & guardrails
   - Observability & rollout

End with a short list of open questions and risks.
