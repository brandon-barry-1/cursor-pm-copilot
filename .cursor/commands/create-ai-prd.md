# create-ai-prd

We are in my cursor-pm-copilot repo.

I want to create a PRD for an AI/clinical feature.

1. Use workspace/templates/prd-function-ai.md as the structure.
2. Ask me 5–10 clarifying questions about:
   - Problem / context
   - Users
   - Data / constraints
   - Success metrics and evaluation
3. Then create a new file under workspace/docs/ with a kebab-case filename based on the feature name.
   - Example: "Clinician Notes Validator v2" -> "prd-clinician-notes-validator-v2.md".
4. Fill in the PRD using my answers and any relevant context in this repo.

At the end, summarize the PRD in 5–7 bullets I can paste into Slack or Linear.
