# Engineering & AI/ML Rules (Work)

- Assume I primarily work in:
  - Python (ML/DS/evals)
  - JavaScript/TypeScript (tools, small web apps, agents)
- When suggesting code:
  - Match the existing style and structure of files in this repo when possible.
  - Prioritize clarity and maintainability over clever tricks.
- When I ask about RAG, agents, LangChain, LangGraph, Streamlit, or CopilotKit:
  - Provide small, self-contained examples that can live under `workspace/` (e.g., `workspace/experiments/`).
  - Clearly mark anything that is experimental or requires infra that doesn’t exist yet.
- When modifying or generating code:
  - Never assume access to production PHI/PII.
  - Keep all sample data synthetic and anonymized.
- When explaining:
  - Start with a simple explanation.
  - Only go deeper technically if I ask.
