# Project Rules – Engineering (cursor-pm-copilot)

- This repo is primarily for PM/TPM workflows and examples, **not** a production service.
- Code examples here should be:
  - Simple, didactic, and easy to follow.
  - Python or TypeScript by default unless the repo clearly dictates another language.
- Prefer:
  - Small, well-commented helpers over large abstractions.
  - Clear, step-by-step explanations when generating code, since this is also a learning environment.
- If you add utilities or tools:
  - Keep them in clearly named locations (for example, `workspace/scripts/`, `.cursor/tools/`).
  - Add a short usage note whenever you create a new helper or tool.
- When I ask you to “wire something up” in this repo:
  - Propose a simple structure first.
  - Explain where each new file will live and what it does.
  - Avoid touching unrelated files unless absolutely necessary.
